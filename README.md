# The Prince
I. Intro

    a. Introduce Setting
    
        * The Renaissance
        
            * During the 16th century
            
            * Start of studying greek phliosophers again
            
            * Dawn of secular political phliosophy
            
    b. Introduce Machiavelli
    
        * Renaissance phliosopher
        
        * "Father of modern political science"
        
        * Summary of his views
        
            * Power
            
            * The state
            
            * Morality
            
        * In 1513 Machiavelli was arrested and tourtured on suspicion of being an assasain for Giovanni de’ Medici.
        
        * Just as arbitrarily, Giovanni de’ Medici becomes Pope Leo X and let go all those being tortured.
    c. Use this too segway into the Prince
    
        * 3 years later Machiavelli publushes the Prince
        
        * It is debaited how much of it is satire
        
        * Segway into its infamy
            * “We are much beholden to Machiavelli and others, that write what men do, and not what they ought to do.” - Francis Bacon
    d. Given the political context surronding this story, along with neumerous scolars interpriting it this way, I will be interpriting this paper as a satire, and judging it accordingly
        
II. Summary
    A. First 2 chapters
    
        1. Describe the idea form of government for our immoral up and coming prince
        
            - Monrarchies with few limits on government power.
            
    B. 3rd Chapter
    
        * Chapter 3 introduces the main ideas such as power, how too get it, and how too manupuilate the publc
        
    C. 4-15 chapters
    
        * These chapoters make up the bulk of this book, and are mainly about manupulating power, manuplating rivals, forming alliances etc.
        
    D. 15-22 chapters
    
        * Focuses on the prince that the book is "talking too"
        
III. Breakdown
            * Macieveli did a good job building a negative ethos of power in Florence using his own experence as reffrence.
    
            * For Macieveli, power defines political power, and authority does not question "what should they do, but what can they do"

            * Macientire rejects the "Right" too government violence

            * For Machiavelli, people are compelled to obey purely in deference to the superior power of the state. 
            
            *  He substantiates this assertion by reference to the observable realities of political affairs and public life as well as by arguments revealing the self-interested nature of all human conduct


IV. Conclusion
           * Overall I think this book has very strong themes and conveys its message well
           * Its a testamate too its time, and still holds its own in modern political science
           * He writes from his own experence, the nature of power, metaphisicas, the human condition, violence, how society develops, and how
